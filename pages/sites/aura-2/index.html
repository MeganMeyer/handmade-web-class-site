      ““Hope” is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tune without the words and never stops at all   -   And sweetest in the Gale is heard and sore must be the storm that could abash the little Bird that kept so many warm   -   I’ve heard it in the chillest land and on the strangest Sea, yet, never, in Extremity, it asked a crumb of me.”   -   Emily Dickinson          //          “Hope springs eternal in the human breast;   -   Man never Is, but always to be blest.   -   The soul, uneasy, and confin'd from home   -   Rests and expatiates in a life to come.”   -   Alexander Pope          //          “You do not have to be good.   -   You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.   -   You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.   -   Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.   -   Meanwhile the world goes on.   -   Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes, over the prairies and the deep trees, the mountains and the rivers.   -   Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air, are heading home again.   -   Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination,   -   calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting   -   over and over announcing your place   -   in the family of things.”   -   Mary Oliver          //
